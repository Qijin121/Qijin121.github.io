# About Me

Here is **Qijin Li (李奇瑾)**.

I am a junior student studying in the School of Information Science and Engineering([**Chongxin College**](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%B4%87%E6%96%B0%E5%AD%A6%E5%A0%82/20809738?fr=aladdin)), [**Shandong University**](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in China. I am also an Research Intern (2024 Summer - Present) at WindyLab, School of Engineering, Westlake University, supervised by Prof. Shiyu Zhao.

## Research Interests

My research interests are **Explainable AI (XAI)** and **Privacy-preserving AI**. Specifically, my research goal is to build faithful XAI systems which are easily understood by users and are robust in various environments (e.g. **XAI4LLM, XAI4NLP, XAI4MM, XAI4CV, XAI4Security** and so on). I am also interested in applying the XAI to real-world scenarios (e.g. optical systems, recommender systems, and traffic forecasting etc.). At the same time, I am also very interested in the research of AI in the field of **astronomy, environmental science, materials and medicine**.

Prior to this, I have also been exposed to bioinformatics, multimodal sentiment analysis, domain generalization and other research areas.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *songninglai[at]hkust-gz[dot]edu[dot]cn*.
